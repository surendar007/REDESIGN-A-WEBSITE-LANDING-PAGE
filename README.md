DESCRIPTION : In the digital age, a website's landing page acts as the front door to an organization or service. It is the first impression users get and plays a crucial role in determining whether visitors stay or leave. The objective of this project is to take an existing website landing page and redesign it to enhance both usability and aesthetics, focusing on user-centered design principles, responsive layout, and modern UI/UX practices.

The process begins with selecting an existing website whose landing page demonstrates outdated design elements, poor navigation, cluttered content, or lacks visual appeal. This can include issues such as non-intuitive layouts, poor color contrast, low responsiveness on mobile devices, or slow loading speeds. The current user experience is analyzed using usability testing methods, including heuristic evaluation and feedback from real users if available.

The redesign focuses on improving three core areas: visual design, user interaction, and performance. In terms of aesthetics, modern web design trends are adopted such as clean layouts, a harmonious color scheme, well-chosen typography, and meaningful imagery or icons. Smooth transitions and subtle animations are incorporated to create an engaging and modern feel without compromising load times.

Usability enhancements include restructuring the information hierarchy, improving CTA (Call-To-Action) button placements, ensuring accessibility (like proper color contrast and readable font sizes), and simplifying navigation. Interactive elements are made more intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices and browsers.
